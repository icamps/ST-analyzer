ST-analyzer
===========

ST-analyzer is a standalone GUI toolset to perform various analyses of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories and provides a variety of analysis routines especially focused on membrane systems (e.g., lipid chain order parameter, lipid area, etc). Since trajectory files are generally too large to upload to a remote server, ST-analyzer has been developed in cross-platform by installing it into a server where trajectories are located. Once ST-analyzer is installed, userâ€™s local machines governed by any types of existing OS can access the ST-analyzer through HTTP. ST-analyzer is also hosted at http://im.bioinformatics.ku.edu/st-analyzer/
